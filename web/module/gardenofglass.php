<b>Garden of Glass</b> is a Botania addon that allows you to create a <b>Skyblock</b>-esque world.<br>
Aside from this, certain items and blocks are added and recipes tweaked to fit Skyblock gameplay better.<br>
This addon is designed so that every single item in the game can be acquired legitimately.<br>
The jarfile required to play in this gamemode is a mod, but contains no code and behaves like a glorified datapack.<br>
It contains some datapack additions to the base game, and tells the base Botania mod to enable other GoG features.<br>

To generate a server world with Garden of Glass, set <span style="font-family:monospace;">level-type</span> to <span style="font-family:monospace;">botania:gardenofglass</span> in your server.properties file.
