<ul>

<li id="q1-fake"><b>Can I use Botania in a modpack, Let's Play? May I use its code in my mod?</b> <a href="#q1">(permalink)</a><br>
Have a look through the <a href="http://botaniamod.net/license.php">license</a> section of the website.</li><br>

<li id="q2-fake"><b>Is Botania open-source?</b> <a href="#q2">(permalink)</a><br>
Yes. <a href="https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania">Yes it is</a>.</li><br>

<li id="q3-fake"><b>When will the mod get updated to 1.x?</b> <a href="#q3">(permalink)</a><br>
It'll be ready when it's ready. Please don't nag about it over email, twitter or what have you all the time, it doesn't help.</li><br>

<li id="q4-fake"><b>How can I contact you?</b> <a href="#q4">(permalink)</a><br>
Check <a href="https://vazkii.net/">my website</a>. Please read this entire FAQ before you do. Please. Just... please.</li><br>

<li id="q5-fake"><b>Can the flowers in this mod be retroactively generated?</b> <a href="#q5">(permalink)</a><br>
No, they can't, due to the way they're generated. You can still get the flowers easily by crafting Floral Fertilizer (an early-game item), though.</li><br>

<li id="q6-fake"><b>There are too many flowers in my world! How do I decrease their amount?</b> <a href="#q6">(permalink)</a><br>
You can lower the frequency (how many patches spawn) and the density (how many spawn in each "patch") in the config.</li><br>

<li id="q7-fake"><b>My flowers disappeared or turned into dead bushes! What gives?</b> <a href="#q7">(permalink)</a><br>
Passive flowers (the Hydroangeas and the now-defunct Daybloom/Nightshade) decay after one in-game hour, transforming into dead bushes when spent. This is normal, and you should consider upgrading to better flowers that don't do that.</li><br>

<li id="q8-fake"><b>Could you add a config option to restrict flowers to specific biomes?</b> <a href="#q8">(permalink)</a><br>
Given that all sixteen flowers are required for recipes, no, this seems like a terrible idea. I have no interest in doing this.<br></li><br>

<li id="q9-fake"><b>My Mana Pool's Mana levels aren't changing! I have a few Generating flowers and the bar's not moving at all, what's wrong?</b> <a href="#q9">(permalink)</a><br>
The Mana Pool holds a <i>lot</i> of mana. Flowers like the Hydroangeas produce very small amounts of it, so you probably won't see a difference. Go get some better flowers (like Endoflames).</li><br>

<li id="q10-fake"><b>I found a bug, how do I report it?</b> <a href="#q10">(permalink)</a><br>
Report it on the <a href="https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania/issues">issue tracker</a>. Please read the <a href="https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md">contributor guidelines</a> first, though!</li><br>

<li id="q11-fake"><b>I have a suggestion for Botania. Where do I put it?</b> <a href="#q11">(permalink)</a><br>
The best place for suggestions is the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/botania">/r/botania</a> subreddit. Before you do, however, please read <a href="https://vazkii.net/blog_archive/#blog/not-in-botania">this blog post</a>, so you don't suggest something that I've denied countless times already. Do keep in mind, however, that Botania is feature-complete; suggestions are very unlikely to make it into the mod at this point in time.</li><br>

<li id="q14-fake"><b>Is the Terra Blade from Terraria?</b> <a href="#q14">(permalink)</a><br>
<a href="https://botaniamod.net/terrablade.html">...</a></li><br>

<li id="q15-fake"><b>Is there a Botania API? Can I make a Botania Addon?</b> <a href="#q15">(permalink)</a><br>
Yes, there is <a href="https://github.com/Vazkii/Botania/tree/master/src/main/java/vazkii/botania/api">an API</a>. You <i>can</i> make addons, but please give me a heads-up about what you're going to add. I can't disallow you from adding things, given the mod's license, but I'd at least like to know what where you're going with it.</li><br>

<li id="q15-fake"><b>What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?</b> <a href="#q16">(permalink)</a><br>
African or European?</li>
