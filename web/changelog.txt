1.16 398
* Welcome to Botania on 1.16.1, brought to you by williewillus and Hubry
* Special thanks to the patrons and players on the patron server for helping test
* Note: 1.16.2 is coming soon and we know it to have some minor breakage. This version may not be directly usable in 1.16.2, but worlds should be upgradable to it perfectly.

* Fix runic altar cube particles

*<b>This version is for Minecraft 1.10.2, and carries on from the latest release of <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/botania-unofficial">Botania Unofficial</a>.</b>
*<b>A massive thanks is due to <a href="https://twitter.com/williewillus">williewillus</a>, who took it upon himself to port and maintain the mod all the way through 1.8, 1.9 and to 1.10. Please go send him love and hugs, as us being here would not be possible without him.</b>
*<b>If you want to know what changed in between, have a look through the Releases page on <a href="https://github.com/williewillus/Botania/releases">williewillus/Botania.</a></b>
*<b>This is the first release for 1.10.2, which sets up for further content expansion, while removing obsolete and bloated pieces of content. More content is planned and will be coming soon.</b>
*<b>You can mitigate your worlds from Botania Unofficial to Botania just fine, any of the removed pieces of content you had in your world will just disappear.</b>
*<b>A few pieces of content from Botania's 1.7.10 releases was removed in Botania Unofficial due to them being added to <a href="http://quark.vazkii.net/">Quark</a>, another mod by me which I highly recommend you install alongside Botania.</b>
*<b>If you were looking for BotaniaV2, most of that project was scrapped in favour of this update instead. I decided that instead of reinventing a mod that's already good, I'd use the concepts there to make a new mod instead, which I am planning, but want to get some new stuff onto Botania and Quark before I move onto that.</b>
*<b>And that's it for my important note. I'm back to Botania, and I hope you carry on enjoying it.</b>

r1.7 234
*Added 3 new lenses:<ul><li>Mana Lens: Redirectory - Bursts that have this lens fired from a spreader will, when colliding with another spreader, rotate the collided spreader to point towards the one that shot. It also gives bursts the Phantom effect.</li><li>Mana Lens: Celebratory - When it collides with a block it'll make a firework of the color of the burst.</li><li>Mana Lens: Flare - Spreader only.

*Added the Solegnolia Petite. Not much to explain here.
*Changed the Lexica Botania's Category Icon Shader to use GL Texture Unit 7 rather than 15. Also added a config option to change which unit is used, just in case. This should fix GL errors with old and integrated graphics cards.

*[API] Increased version number to 65

*Changed the "no mana killzone" of the Dandelifeon from a 5x5 to a 7x7. <i>To be honest, I really don't know where I'm going with this one. It's seeming to me like it's a failed experiment, as the optimal build always ends up being a really simple thing, which I'm not a big fan of. I'm just trying various things and seeing what sticks. I might end up removing it alltogether.</i>
*Changed the Gaia Guardian's health to 800 (from 300) and the damage cap to 35 (from 12), 50 if it's a crit. In a way, if you're properly prepared, the boss is actually easier now as it's definitely possible to hit that hard with the proper enchants and potions, it just requires preparation.

*[API] Increased version number to 64.
r1.7 223
*Added code to safely crash the game if someone overrides the Botania API's Internal Method Handler. Overriding the Internal Method Handler is a sure fire way to crash the game or cause incompatibility problems later down the line, so at least you're getting informed about it with a proper error message.

*Fixed a circular dependency chain with DragonAPI not allowing for the game to load.
*Fixed Red Stringed Conparators only seeing half of a double chest.

*Sparks now produce less, but bigger, particles to make it less likely to reach the particle limit.
*The Mana Pool's "water" icon is now a different icon and not the one used for water. (it still looks the same, it's just in a different file)

*The high council of Elven Garde, after having received countless unintended "gifts" of unenchanted Iron Ingots, Diamonds and Ender Pearls from unskilled skim-reading botanists are now returning those back to the senders.
*Tweaked the Elven Portal's render a bit. The lighting on it doesn't spazz out and it renders properly when you're in it now.
r1.7 214

So this line should read "Fixed the Flugel Tiara's sprint delay being 1.5 seconds rather than the intended 2 seconds", but the intended was 3 seconds before and 2 seconds now because 2 seconds feels better than 3 seconds. I don't even know.
*Fixed the Hand of Ender being stackable.

*Changed the Cocoon of Caprice's texture to be 64x32 rather than 48x32, that apparently was making it not display properly in some setups.

*Fixed the Cocoon of Caprice not saving its data properly. (Titanium237458)

*If you lose your Lexica Botania in Garden of Glass you can now exchange a Sapling for it by right clicking with it on the Mana Flame.
*The Endoflame now caps how much each fuel is worth to the value of a Coal Block. It can still accept larger fuels, but they are capped to a Coal Block. <i>Now, before you start raging and raising your pitchforks around at this, please think about what botania tries to do, and how much super condensed fuels like Aeternalis Fuel Blocks negate that. Ok, you chill now?</i>

*Functional and Generating Flowers no longer rebind to the closest spreader/pool if the one they were bound to stops existing. Instead, they'll keep the binding in the position and wait for a new spreader/pool to appear there. Of course you can still rebind manaully. This is a workaround for the bug where flowers would lose or change their binding on chunk unload, which is hopefully fixed now :T

*Fixed the Ring of Loki not working properly. (TheWhiteWolves)
*Hardcore Passive Generation is now enabled by default at 2 days (24000 ticks). This is the config that makes passive flowers decay after some time. Old configs won't be affected, but you should change yours to reflect this, especially if you're a modpack author (please D:).

*Fixed flowers sometimes binding to the wrong pool or spreader when their chunk is loaded.

*Fixed the Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate desyncing if the server is lagging and potentially destroying all the mana used if one picks up the item too early in those circumstances.
*Made the Black Lotus rarely appear in Bonus Chests.
*Made the Fallen Kanade not work in the end to prevent cheesing the Ender Dragon.
*Mana Sparks now try to update the list of sparks they can transfer to after they're done ticking. Dominant Sparks will also attempt to pull mana from sparks at random rather than iteratively. When a Mana Pool with a Dominant Spark is charging an item and is full, instead of pulling from one Mana Pool exclusively it randomly pulls from all possible pools around.
*Mana Tablets now render on the player's belt, if there's one.
*Mana tools now have right click abilities. The Pickaxe places a torch from the inventory, the Axe does the same for a sapling and the Shovel works as a Hoe.
*Nerfed the Bands of Aura. A lot.
*Removed the health boost from Terrasteel Armor.
*Removed the item name remapper. It's completely useless at this point unless by some reason you're updating from a 10 month old build. It was also breaking downgrading as it was trying to remap items that didn't exist. 
*Removed the transparency in the HUD mana bars, as it looked absolutely god awful in higher resolutions/scales.
*The Elementium Pickaxe (and Elementium Tipped Terra Shatterer) will now look in the ore dictionary for what blocks not to break. Should help with Underground Biomes and other mods that add new stones.
*The Lexica Botania's in hand animation uses partial ticks now and isn't locked to 20fps any more. It looks so much smoother. <i>GLORIOUS 60FPS PC MASTER RACE</i>
*The Mana Prism can now be turned off with a redstone signal.
*The Tiny Potato can now be named in an anvil. It can also sing.
*Trodden Dirt now expands to a full block if there's a block above it.

r1.3 152
*Added the Black Lotus, a dungeon loot consumable that can be tossed onto a Mana Pool for a boost of mana.
*Added the Mana Prism, a new block that can change the properties of a Mana Burst on the fly.
*Added Trodden Dirt, a new block that looks great for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path">desire paths</a>. It also gives a slight speed boost. The texture and idea come from <a href="http://redd.it/2sqwu6">/u/LupusX's post on reddit</a>.
*Red String Spoofers will now also connect to mushrooms.
*Shifted the Assembly Halo HUD down 10px so it fits on smaller resolution/render scales.
*The Brewery and Enchanter now have the same progress pie as the Runic Altar.
*The Magnet Ring will no longer pull items that can contain mana, items that are on a terrasteel plate or AE2 crystal seeds.
*(Technical) IManaTrigger blocks with IManaCollisionGhost tile entities will still have their effect triggered. Furthermore IManaTrigger triggers for fake bursts too so that should be checked against.
*[API] Added IManaDissolvable and IDyablePool.
*[API] Increased version number to 29.
r1.3 151
*Fixed the Terra Shatterer.
r1.3 150
*Fixed a crash when using the crafting halo to make extra utils unstable ingots.
*Fixed more tpyos. <i>This is becoming a dank meme.</i>
*Fixed other mods' GUIs turning blue while the mana bar is being rendered. <i>They really should reset the glColor before rendering...</i>
*Fixed the Mana Fluxfield not sending energy to every RF receiver. (yueh)
*Fixed the Mana Fluxfield requiring the CoFH API to be present to work rather than the CoFH Energy API. (Vexatos)
*Fixed tools that break multiple blocks (manasteel shovel, terra shatterer) causing dupes with thermal expansion tanks and strongboxes and potentially other blocks that require exact harvest method call order.
r1.3 149
*Fixed Dominant Sparks being able to pull from blocks other than Mana Pools.
*Fixed Flashes dropping themselves.
*Moved the following flowers to elven knowledge: Thermalily, Kekimurus, Heisei Dream, Orechid, Loonium.
*Open Crates will now eject into the block below not only if it's an air block but also if it has no collision box. So yes, you can drop stuff on water now.
r1.3 148
*<i>I could have fit this on 147 but I only decided to do it later :V</i>
*Added support for <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/1445251-1-7-10-beta-wip-colored-light-progress-and">Colored Lights</a>. (<a href="http://puu.sh/dKo8o/7c34ca4d3d.png">Picture 1</a>) (<a href="http://puu.sh/dKozh/323db4f589.png">Picture 2</a>) You can find it in the following blocks:<ul><li>Glimmering Flowers</li><li>Floating Flowers (colored normal ones only)</li><li>Buried Petals</li><li>Sea Lanterns</li><li>Flashes</li></ul>
*Buried petals now emit a faint light.

*Fixed flowers sometimes rendering as floating due to the Y position shift in the render.
r1.3 146
*<i>Added some christmas spark. ARE YOU JINGLING YOUR BELLS YET?!</i>
*Fixed a major dupe with the Assembly Halo where right clicking a recipe would allow for more than one item to be crafted at once using only one set of resources.
*Fixed the render for the flowers not randomizing the position in the Z axis like vanilla flowers do. It still randomizes in the Y axis unlike vanilla flowers because I think it looks good.
*Sparks now properly check against how much space is left on the target block and don't try to put in more mana than available, actually making spark networks viable. <i>You can all point and laugh now.</i>
*The Assembly Halo is now more forceful with checking the validity of a recipe. It can no longer craft recipes purely from memory (and allowing as a way to craft things that have been changed since)
*The Mana Mirror now checks for the pool on update and has a backlog for calls inbetween. It also works cross dimension a lot better.
*[API] Added getAvailableSpaceForMana() to ISparkAttachable. This is very important and breaks backwards compatibility. If anyone is using that interface please adapt ASAP.
*[API] Increased version number to 28.
r1.3 145
*Added the Mana Lens: Flash. It makes fancy lights!
*Botania Flowers now shift a bit depending on position similarly to vanilla flowers since 1.7. <i>About time.</i>

r1.3 141

*Fixed the Rod of the Arcane Barrage crashing servers >_>

*[API] Added IBaubleRender.
*[API] SubTileEntities now have an internal ticker.
*[API] Updated version number to 24.

r1.3 138
*"Added" a new item that works but is creative only for now, I'll work on it some more later >_>

*The enchanter will now always properly reset the pylons' particle emitting status.
r1.3 137
*Fixed RedStringRenderer looking for the codechicken Vector3 rather than the botania one. On other words, Fixed the game crashing if you have a wand of the forest equipped while you have a red string block in the world and codechickencore isn't installed.
*Fixed the Red Stringed Spoofer not being in the creative tab.
*Fixed the Terra Shatterer not actively restoring its damage like the manasteel tools do.
*Fixed the recipes for breaking back Reed and Thatch blocks giving items with metadata 1, and thus unusable.
r1.3 136
*<b>Added Red String and Red Stringed Blocks</b>. These can interact with other blocks remotely.
*Calling setWater on the petal apothecary now calls for a block update. <i>This is technical stuff for other modders only.</i>
*Changed some minor details in some lexicon entries so they are accurate to recent changes.
*Changed the brewery texture to a more appropriate one. (Yulife)
*Combining a Floating (any color) Flower with any botania flower with an effect (manastar, pure daisy, any generating or functional...) will replace the flower there with the one you put. The flower will still act like normally, but has the visual and technical properties of a Floating Flower.
*Fixed mod slabs letting light pass through.
*Fixed some tpyos in the elven lore page. <i>I desperately need someone to proofread the nonsense I write.</i>
*Fixed the game crashing if one tries to look up uses for the Tainted Blood Pendant in NEI.
*Fixed the runic altar not saving the amount of mana it should get (and thus causing the amount of mana it has to reset to 0 when it loads back).
*Fixed there being a missing texture on the terra plate, resulting in some unneeded log errors.
*Having Night Vision on a Tainted Blood Pendant will no longer make the brightness blink obnoxiously.
*Hopefully fixed entry sharing being somewhat fiddly in SMP.
*Removed the text that says that Bursts would work in the Terrasteel crafting, because it seems everyone gets confused and decides not to use sparks even though it clearly says it's the best way >.<

*The Gaia Guardian now spawns a few less mobs and spawns them in a smaller radius. It won't spawn pig zombies or spiders any more, but you might get witches.
*When a spark is placed in the world it displays what sparks it can connect to, this can be duplicated by right clicking it with a wand.
r1.3 134
*Fixed crash when looking at a mana pool if dark quartz is disabled in the config.
*Fixed the terrasteel plate taking mana from spreaders even if it isn't active.

*<b>1.7.2 is no longer supported.</b>
*Added a Brew of Restoration, it's like the brew of Revitalization but it's Regeneration I for 2 minutes and uses redstone in the crafting.
*Added new lore/backstory pages for the events that separated the elves' world from the overworld. It's worth a read, but not required. Some text in the original entries was also changed to reflect.
*Added the Tainted Blood Pendant, it can store potions and give the player their effects while it's worn, for the cost of mana.
*Added the Terrestrial Agglomeration Plate, which serves as the new method to create Terrasteel. You'd be wise to look at the Terrasteel page to check out how it works. It's pretty similar to the old method but allows for more control and can be done earlier in the game.
*Changed the Gaia Guardian fight a whole bunch, it's harder now to compensate for the new items and the fact that it can take damage from the Terra Blade now. Brews and a Terra Blade are a must now. The entry in the lexicon now describes the recommended gear. You can see what it does for yourself ;)
*Fixed the Alfglass recipe using Glass instead of Managlass as it should.
*Fixed the Brew of Mending not working.
*Fixed the Brewery breaking instantly. Added added the proper block texture for breaking.

*Increased the max amount of mana a Terra Shatterer can hold up to <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#MAX_VALUE">2147483647</a>. If you manage to reach this value you also get a fancy congratulatory message.

*[API] LexiconCategory now implements Comparable, has a sorting priority int and keeps count on how many were added for addon makers to be able to have their entries be sorted. The default (and used by botania categories) is 5, entries like basics and misc use 9 and 0, respectively. Use setPriority() to set.

*The Runic Altar's render now has a smoother trail rather than a bunch of cubes all with the same alpha value.
*[API] Added IGrassHornExcempt, for blocks that extend BlockBush but shouldn't be uprooted by the Horn of the Wild. Note that ISpecialFlower implementers will be excempt by default.

r1.2 127

*Fixed Mana Pools not registering the catalyst below them on the first tick, so if an item was transformed upon loading the world it could've been transformed to the non-catalyst recipe.
*Fixed the default flower spawn rates being wrong (3 and 32). They're now 2 and 16. <i>Funny story, this was supposed to have been changed in build 90, but wasn't due to an oversight on my part. Regardless, it's now :V</i>

*Mana Spreaders now unbind themselves from the wand when bound to something, no need to do it manually.
*Reorienting spreaders (and binding flowers now) has a beam effect as a visual confirmation.

*Fixed crashes with the Force Relay with the Little Blocks Mod.

*Mana Pools in the Lexica Botania now render with mana in them, that just makes sense right?
*Mana Pools now come in two tiers. Diluted and [normal]. The diluted one only stores 1% of what the normal one can and is what you get by crafting it now, it can't infuse any items but a normal mana pool, which is acquired by tossing a Diluted Mana Pool into one with mana.

*The Gaia Traps (purple spots the Gaia Guardian summons) now only blind for a fraction of a second instead of four seconds.
*The Rod of the Lands no longer works below sea level (Y = 62), this is to prevent it from being used as a ghetto underground quarry.

*The Shard of Laputa is now upgradable using aditional Gaia Spirits, each one increases the radius by 1 block, up to 20 can be used.
*The Soujourner's and Globetrotter's Sashes no longer work underwater, so you can't go at hyperspeed underwater. <i>Godspeed, Godspeed, Godspeed, speed us away</i>

*Added "dammit reddit".
*Added a config option to disable the Mana Enchanter.
*Added the Crimson Pendant, a "tier 2" Pyroclast Pendant that does what the old one used to pre-nerf.
*Added the Hand of Ender, an item that allows not only for access of one's ender chest, but of others' via right clicking on them. (the last feature can be toggled in the config).
*Added The Spectator, a new bauble that lets you search for items in inventories, dropped around, in players/horses' inventories, equipped by mobs and that villagers trade.
*Changed the recipe for the Pyroclast Pendant to make more sense with the recent nerf.
*The Pixies the Gaia Guardian spawns no longer take non-player damage, so you can't cheese the battle with Tiny Planet + Terra Blade. <i>Sorry Lewis :3</i>
r1.1 94
*Added Mob Spawners to the Botania creative tab. Using a spawn egg on them changes the mob it's spawning, similar to MC:PE.
*Added the Ender Overseer, a new block that detects when players are looking at it and gives out a redstone signal.
*Nerfed the Pyroclast Pendant, now it only protects the wearer from fire damage if they are not standing on fire or lava.
r1.1 93
*Actually fix the skull renderer because I'm an undereducated idiot who has no clue what they're doing or how the java compiler works :V
r1.1 92

*[API] Increased version number to 6.
r1.1 91
*Added new building blocks: Reed Block, Thatch, Netherrack Bricks, Soul Bricks, Snow Bricks, <a href="http://www.madeireirafalsarella.com.br/arquivos/produtos/telhas/portuguesa/01-g.jpg">Roof Tiles</a> (all with stair and slab variants) and 12 types of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azulejo">Azulejos</a> for use with white Quartz.
*Hopperhocks will no longer pick items up right after a mana pool crafts them.
*I was playing with TC and realized I wanted Botania armor mixed in with the Goggles of Revealing, so you can do that now.
*Lowered the chance for the Lexica Botania to spawn in the Bonus Chest, according to almighty reddit it was too high.
*Player heads now render with the hat/hair layer as they do in the normal model, so your crafted heads won't look weird now. Thanks to Kihira for this!
*Removed the Baubles Button from the inventory as that feature is provided by Baubles itself now.
r1.1 90
*Added a new generating flower, the Gourmaryllis, it eats food to make mana, but there's a catch...

*Fixed chat spam when using a Wand of the Forest or spawning pixies.
*Fixed the Kindle Lens destroying blocks.

*Lowered default flower quantity and density to 2 and 16 respectively (was 3 and 32).
*Lowered default villager shed avg interval from 82000 to 226000 (this won't affect old configs).
*The Hopperhock is now more efficient at picking up items and picks up any it can find instead of just one at a time, this makes automating systems that require timing a lot easier.
*The Hopperhock now respects inventory max stack sizes.
*The Mana Enchanter is more expensive and puts less empahsis in the rarity of the enchantment.
*The Mana Pool no longer has a cooldown between being able to craft items but rather a timer on when it can "re-craft" an item after it crafted it (see wood log transmutation for example).
*The Mana Pool will no longer emit charging/discharging FX if no transfer happened (when either the pool or the item is full/empty).
*The Snowflake Pendant no longer creates ghost ice blocks in the client and is now properly centered on the player.
*Toned down the mana pool charging/discharging fx for sake of performance.

*Added some Illustrations to the Daybloom and Hydroangeas entries to explain better how they work.
*Added the Life Imbuer, a means of allowing spawners to work without players nearby.
*If a Wand of the Forest is bound to a spreader, it'll always show that spreader's bounding box instead of any other, to make it more obvious.
*Spreaders now aim to the center of blocks taking their collision box in mind and not a 1x1x1 box.

*Added the Rod of the Highlands, an upgrade to the Rod of the Lands that lets you place blocks in midair.
*Changed some documentation.<ul><li>The Runic Altar's entry now has a small preface telling players they should look into Mana Manipulation first.</li><li>The Mana Spreader's entry now has clearer instructions for how the rotating is done and documentation for the fact that you can disable it with a redstone signal.</li><li>The disclaimer that lenses only function when there's a proper block to shoot at has been changed and moved to a single page rather than being on various lenses' pages.</li></ul>
*Fixed Mana Burst particles going above the spreader on the first few ticks.
*Fixed shaders not compiling sometimes and causing crashes/log spam. <i>I have no idea what I'm doing :V</i>

*Fixed the Hyacidus wasting mana by trying to poison undead.

r1.1 87
*Fixed Mana Spreaders freezing your game, woot!
*Removed the ability for the Rod of the Seas to place water in the nether, after some thought it wasn't that great of an idea after all.

*<b>Botania should now work properly in a developer environment</b> and not complain about sand in it's eyes or something.

*Added the Infrangible Platform, a counterpart to the Abstruse and Spectral Platforms only available in creative, its' collision box is similar to a regular block and it's unbreakable, it's meant for mapmakers, see.
*Added the Ring of Far Reach (Elven Knowledge), it increases your reach by 3 blocks.
*Changed the Terra Shatterer texture to Futureazoo's. See previous link.
*Fixed the Drum of the Gathering dropping the Drum of the Wild instead.
*Fixed the Mana Lens crafting recipe only allowing you to use invalid combinations instead of valid ones.
*Fixed the Shard of Laputa...<ul><li>Being allowed to go above world height.</li><li>Sometimes having an offset of 1 block.</li><li>Being able to be used in the nether</li><li>Being able to mobilize Bedrock and other unbreakable blocks.<li>Overriding any blocks already in the area.</li><li>Stopping if the player relogs.</li><li>Creating bursts that can be pulled by the Tiny Planet <i>(lol)</i>.</li></ul>
*Fixed the Tiny Planet creating way too many particles when used with the Terra Blade.

*The Petal Apothecary now has a smarter checking for what it considers seeds. Read: Natura Hop<i>seed</i> wood won't work now :p
*Tweaked the Mana Burst particles, now they never leave any empty space between them, so you get a proper straight burst when you fire it with a mana blaster instead of a bunch of loose particles. The color and size also randomizes a bit to make each burst distint, even if just by a bit.
r1.1 83
*Changed the Lexicon HUD icon to be a lot less intrusive.
*Fixed Gaia Pylons' in-world lexicon click going to the wrong entry.
*Shaders now use GLSL version 120 instead of whatever they feel like. Should fix issues with some GPUs having lag with them enabled. If your GPU doesn't support GLSL version 120 you should consider upgrading (or turning shaders off in the config I guess).
*The Charm of the Diva is now a lot more reliable.
r1.1 82
*Added a config option to disable the animation when an item is charging on a mana pool.
*Added some Botania loot to the Bonus Chest, Stronghold and Dungeon chests.

r1.1 77
*Added NBT tags for mapmakers to allow control of whether Mana Pools can input/output mana to items.
*Added an IO Key system for mapmakers that allows them to define which pools/spreaders a spreader is allowed to shoot mana to.

*Fixed Bifrost blocks being pickupable in creative.
*Fixed some seeds not getting picked up by the petal apothecary (any registered with "Seed" in the name rather than "seed" because the check was case sensitive). (ganymedes01)

*The Flugel Tiara is now made with Elementium.
*The Mana Usage display for Mana Infusion and Runic Crafting recipes in the Lexica Botania now shows that it's on a 10:1 ratio. Hovering over the bar changes it to 1:1 ratio.

*Added <a href="https://twitter.com/Vazkii/status/484136285251309568">Matrix Mode</a> as a config option. This was a visual glitch I got while changing the particle code that I decided to leave in because it was funny.
r1.1 69
