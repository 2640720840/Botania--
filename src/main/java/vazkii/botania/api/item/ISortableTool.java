	 * Gets the priority that this tool should have when being sorted. The

	 * should be (tool-level) * 100 + (tool-modifier) * 10 + (efficiency-level).
	 * <br>
	 * <br>
	 * For example, a <b>Manasteel Pickaxe</b> is tool-level 10 and it doesn't have
	 * modifiers. Assuming Efficiency 4, the priority should be 10 * 100 + 4 = <b>1004</b>.
	 * This will rate higher than a similar pickaxe with Efficiency 3.<br>
	 * A <b>Terra Shatterer</b> has a modifier, its rank and is tool-level 20. With Efficiency
	 * 5 and rank B (2) the priority should be 20 * 100 + 2 * 10 + 5 = <b>2025</b>.
	 * <br>
	 * <br>
	 * All intermediate tool levels are there for other mod tools that wish to occupy the spots inbetween.
	 * Of course, you don't have to always adhere to this. Tools like the <b>Vitreous Pickaxe</b> don't,
	 * that one in particular is priority 0, unless looking at glass, in which case it's {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}.
