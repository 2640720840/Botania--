Pending 1.17 gameplay changes:
- Mana Detector no longer a BE/handles collisions more smartly (on a branch)
- Turntable can face any direction and rotates about that axis
- Turntable entities? (when facing up)
- Spark traversal rewrite?
- stackable lenses?
- cacophonium copper
- new pure daisy recipes
- infusion ring tuff -> calcite -> deepslate
- antioxidizing flower? or some way to reverse oxidation (pure daisy?)
- no therma nerf (because dispensers cannot extract from cauldrons)
- refine "left owner" detection for mana bursts
